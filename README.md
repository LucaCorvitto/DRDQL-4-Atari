# DRDQL-4-Atari
Pytorch implementation of Deep Recurrent (Double) Q-Learning.

# References
The baseline codes for DQN and DDQN are taken by [Hauf3n](https://github.com/Hauf3n) in its repository [DDQN-Atari-PyTorch](https://github.com/Hauf3n/DDQN-Atari-PyTorch) and slighlty modified.

The architectures of DRQN and DRDQN are taken by the paper [Performing Deep Recurrent Double Q-Learning for Atari Games](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340060033_Performing_Deep_Recurrent_Double_Q-Learning_for_Atari_Games)
